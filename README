Chronix is a free and open source enterprise-class batch job scheduler. It aims to fully replace other commercial schedulers.

The main differencing features of Chronix are:

* Event-driven, which allows for truly optimal plan executions - and therefore shorter plans
* Easy to use web-based graphical interface, exposing even the most advanced function in a user-friendly manner
* Full support for business calendars, tokens, sequences, ...
* Integrated parameter manager for your jobs (including dynamic parameters fetched through SQL or shell commands, passing a value from a job to another...)
* Distributed system, each of your servers being independent - making Chronix truly robust and scalable
* Centralized administration - making it a breeze to use every day
* Can run anywhere thanks to Java
