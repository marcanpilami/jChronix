jChronix uses two programming languages : JavaScript (as in HTML 5) for the GUI and Java (6) for everything else.
Both follow similar conventions.

In both cases, an Eclipse formatter is provided. Its use is compulsory.

.. warning:: you should **always** do Shift+Control+F (equivalent to menu Source -> Format) before committing. 
 
Both languages
